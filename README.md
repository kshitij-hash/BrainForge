# BrainForge

It is a web-based productivity tool designed to help users stay focused and organized during work or study sessions. It replaces your **empty tab**, providing a productive environment right from the start.

## Features

- **Study Session Timer**: Users can set a study session timer with a duration ranging from 25 minutes to 2 hours. Breaks of 5 minutes are automatically provided during the session based on its length.

- **Daily Routine Guide**: The application provides a predefined list of suggested tasks for maintaining productivity, mental, and physical health. Tasks include consistency, workouts, meditation, reading goals, and tips for minimizing distractions. This list is uneditable and remains constant.

- **Daily Tasks Manager**: Users can add and manage up to 6 todos per day within the application. Todos are editable and can be deleted. Each todo item includes a checkbox to mark it as completed.

- **Reflection Prompt**: At the end of each session, users are prompted with a simple "Did I do enough today?" question. Clicking the "Yes" button triggers a confetti animation as a reward for completing the session.

## Persistence and Daily Reset

This project is integrated with **localStorage**, ensuring that users won't lose track of their todos or ongoing study sessions if they accidentally close the tab or browser. This feature provides a seamless experience by preserving data across sessions.

Additionally, the application automatically clears the task list at midnight as a new day starts. This ensures that users start each day with a fresh set of tasks, promoting ongoing productivity and goal-setting.
